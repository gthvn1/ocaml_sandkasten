This is my personal OCaml playground. A chaotic, ever-growing dune workspace where I dump all my toy projects,
weird experiments, and half-baked ideas. Nothing here is polished, documented, or meant for public consumption.
Itâ€™s just a sandbox for me to break things, test wild hypotheses, and occasionally stumble upon something cool.

(Youâ€™ve been warned.) ðŸ§ªðŸ”¥

# Hints
- Check for correctness: `opam lint .`
- Build all targets: `dune build`
- Build a specific project: `dune build crepe`
- Run a project: `dune exec crepe`
- Launch a REPL for a project: `dune utop crepe`
- Browse module documentation in your terminal: `ocp-browser`
- Look the source: `batcat $(ocamlfind query unix)/unix.mli`
