# Maze

This project is a small experiment to practice OCaml while building something fun.
It simulates a maze with a robot, boxes, and walls. The robot can move around, push boxes, and interact with the environment according to simple rules.

The goal isn't to create a complete game, but to explore:
- Representing a maze with immutable data structures.
- Managing state (robot position, boxes) separately from the static board.
- Experimenting with movement rules, collisions, and pushing mechanics.
- displaying the maze in a graphical window using [Graphics](https://ocaml.org/manual/4.07/libref/Graphics.html).

Itâ€™s a playground project to learn more about [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), functional programming, and game-like logic step by step.

- To run it just `dune exec maze`
